      <p>Firstly, Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal site! I purchased this domain as I thought it would be a great way to experiment with my development and it helped that it was a great clean domain to pick up, but it occured to me the ambiguity of the name created an open ended creative direction to allow me to build in a theme that matched the name. As simple as that, the theme of space and the vast unknown abyss that it is gave me a theme to work around.</p>
      
      <p>On top of this, I feel its a great centralised place to show off my evolving development abilities in other projects as well as hopefully allow an impressive experience as a whole. Also - please feel free to check out the 'blog section' - I will update this over time, its more of a personal yet public thought diary that I intend to add upon throughout my personal and professional life. Quality may vary :)</p>
