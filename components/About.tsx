      <p>
        Welcome to my digital space. This site serves as a real-time portfolio
        of my development journey, which began in June 2024 with a simple
        &apos;Hello World&apos;.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach to building software is a partnership. I act as the director
        and architect, leveraging AI as a development partner to execute a clear
        vision. This modern, augmented workflow allows me to accelerate what was
        previously only possible with years of traditional experience, enabling
        rapid experimentation and the creation of complex, end-to-end
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        All projects showcased here are solo endeavors, born from a drive to
        build tools that are exciting and useful. Each one is a step forward in
        refining my ability to design and deliver high-quality solutions. For a
        more in-depth look into my thoughts, experiments, and development
        philosophy, I invite you to explore the blog section - this will be
        updated sporadically dependent on when I have something to discuss.
