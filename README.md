# Abyss Global

## Description
An interactive 3D landing page with a space theme, built as a personal portfolio to showcase development projects, a blog, and contact functionality. The site features immersive 3D visuals using React Three Fiber, smooth scrolling with Lenis, and backend integration with Supabase for dynamic blog posts and EmailJS for form submissions. This project demonstrates full-stack capabilities, AI integration in workflows, and modern web engineering.

The site is currently in final preparation for deployment via Vercel. It has 0 linted errors (via ESLint with strict Next.js config), is fully formatted with Prettier, and has been stress-tested locally for performance, responsiveness, and functionality.

## Features
- **Preloader**: Custom loader with glowing logo and text for a smooth initial load.
- **3D Scene**: Rotating Earth model with purple tints, custom-written shaders for starfield effects (flicker, glow, noise-based variation), and auras for a cosmic background.
- **Sections**:
  - Hero: Introductory glow text.
  - About: Personal background and development philosophy, with a "Check the Blog!" button.
  - Projects: Three showcased projects with images, embedded YouTube demos (for applicable ones), descriptions, and links.
  - Contact: Form with validation, EmailJS integration, and direct links (Email, Telegram, X).
- **Blog**: Dynamic posts from Supabase, with pagination (3 posts/page for testing; adjustable), individual post views with timestamps, and back navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts, hamburger menu, and adaptive 3D rendering.
- **Animations**: GSAP-powered reveals and bursts; reduced motion support.
- **SEO/Metadata**: OpenGraph tags for social sharing.
- **Footer**: Copyright and 3D model credits.
